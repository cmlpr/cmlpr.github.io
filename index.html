                            <p class="intro"> Welcome to my personal space where I share a little bit about myself and things that I work on and/or like.  
                                I'm a Mechanical Engineer with PhD. In my current role as Research Scientist at Air Products and Chemicals Inc., 
                                I focus on developing new technologies for the cryogenic air separation processes. 
                                The cool thing about my job is that I can work on both experiments and computational models spanning a wide range of subjects 
                                such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, distillation, flow visualization, CFD, optimization, simulation, data analytics, statistics..
